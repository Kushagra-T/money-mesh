# Conditional Navigation Based on Account Status

## Overview
The navigation menu now intelligently shows or hides certain features based on whether the customer has created any bank accounts. This improves the user experience by preventing access to features that require an account until one is created.

## Implementation

### 1. AuthContext Enhancement
**File:** `frontend-redesign/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added:
- `hasAccounts` state: Tracks whether the user has any accounts
- `checkUserAccounts()` function: Fetches user accounts and updates state
- Automatic check on login and when user state changes
- Persists to localStorage for consistency

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // ... existing fields
  hasAccounts: boolean
  checkUserAccounts: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### 2. Layout Component Updates
**File:** `frontend-redesign/src/components/Layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `requiresAccount` flag to each navigation section
- Sections marked as requiring accounts:
  - ✅ Investments (Portfolio, FDs, RDs, Mutual Funds, SIP)
  - ✅ Payments (UPI, QR Codes, Bill Payments)
  - ✅ Analytics & Planning (Analytics, Budgets, Goals)
  - ✅ Tax & Wealth (Tax Dashboard, Tax Calculator, Wealth Dashboard, Retirement Planner)
  - ✅ Loans & Credit (All loan-related features, Credit Score)
  - ✅ Rewards (Rewards Dashboard, Redemption Store)

- Sections always visible (don't require accounts):
  - ✅ Banking (Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Transfers, Cards)
  - ✅ Insurance (Insurance, Claims)

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
const visibleNavSections = customerNavSections.filter(section => 
  !section.requiresAccount || hasAccounts
)
```

### 3. Dashboard Updates
**File:** `frontend-redesign/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Calls `checkUserAccounts()` when loading dashboard data
- Enhanced "no accounts" message to inform users about restricted features
- Removed "Explore Features" button (was linking to calculators)
- Added informational note about feature availability

### 4. Accounts Page Updates
**File:** `frontend-redesign/src/pages/Accounts.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Calls `checkUserAccounts()` after loading accounts
- Calls `checkUserAccounts()` immediately after creating a new account
- This ensures navigation menu updates in real-time

## User Flow

### New Customer Without Accounts
1. Logs in → Redirected to Dashboard
2. Sees "Create Your First Account" message
3. Navigation shows only:
   - Banking (basic features)
   - Insurance
   - Settings
   - Notifications

### After Creating First Account
1. Creates account via "Create Account Now" button or "/add-account" page
2. `checkUserAccounts()` is called automatically
3. Navigation menu updates immediately to show all sections:
   - Banking
   - Investments ✨ (newly visible)
   - Payments ✨ (newly visible)
   - Analytics & Planning ✨ (newly visible)
   - Insurance
   - Tax & Wealth ✨ (newly visible)
   - Loans & Credit ✨ (newly visible)
   - Rewards ✨ (newly visible)
4. User can now access all features

## Technical Details

### State Management
- **Primary Source:** `/api/accounts` endpoint
- **Caching:** localStorage (`hasAccounts` key)
- **Refresh Triggers:**
  - Login
  - Dashboard load
  - Account creation
  - Accounts page load

### Admin Users
- Admins always have `hasAccounts = true`
- Admin navigation is unaffected (shows only admin-specific menu)
- Admins see 3 menu items:
  - Manage Customers
  - Create Customer & Account
  - Loan Approvals

### Customer Users
- Navigation dynamically filtered based on `hasAccounts`
- Smooth UX: No page reload needed when account is created
- Persistent state across browser sessions

## Benefits

1. **Better UX:** Users aren't overwhelmed with unavailable features
2. **Clear Guidance:** Dashboard clearly shows what's needed to unlock features
3. **Real-time Updates:** Navigation updates immediately after account creation
4. **Consistent State:** localStorage ensures consistency across tabs/sessions
5. **Scalable:** Easy to mark new features as requiring/not requiring accounts

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: New Customer
1. Create a customer profile only (no account)
2. Login as customer
3. Verify only Banking and Insurance sections are visible
4. Navigate to Accounts page
5. Create an account
6. Verify all sections become visible immediately

### Test Scenario 2: Existing Customer
1. Login as customer with existing accounts
2. Verify all navigation sections are visible
3. Check localStorage has `hasAccounts: true`

### Test Scenario 3: Admin
1. Login as admin
2. Verify admin navigation (3 items)
3. Create customer with account via admin interface
4. Customer should have all features visible on first login

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Show "locked" icon on restricted features instead of hiding them
- Display tooltip explaining why feature is locked
- Progressive unlocking (some features after 1 account, others after multiple accounts)
- Badge showing "X more features available" when account is created
- Analytics tracking: How many users create accounts after seeing restricted navigation
