## 🔧 Database Cleanup Script

The cleanup script is saved at:
```
/Users/akshatsanjayagrwal/Desktop/bankingsystem/clear-database.sql
```

To run again in the future:
```bash
mysql -u root banking_system < /Users/akshatsanjayagrwal/Desktop/bankingsystem/clear-database.sql
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Foreign Key Checks:** Script temporarily disables foreign key checks during cleanup
2. **Admin Preserved:** Admin account is never deleted
3. **Irreversible:** This operation cannot be undone - all customer data is permanently deleted
4. **Safe Operation:** Database structure remains intact, only data is removed
