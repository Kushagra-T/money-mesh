## üéØ Premium Calculation Algorithm

### Base Rates by Insurance Type
```java
LIFE: 5.0%
HEALTH: 8.0%
TERM: 3.0%
AUTO: 6.0%
HOME: 4.0%
TRAVEL: 10.0%
ACCIDENT: 5.0%
CRITICAL_ILLNESS: 12.0%
DISABILITY: 7.0%
LOAN_PROTECTION: 4.0%
```

### Calculation Formula
```
Annual Premium = (Coverage Amount √ó Base Rate) / 100

Adjusted Premium = switch(Frequency) {
    MONTHLY: Annual Premium / 12
    QUARTERLY: Annual Premium / 4
    HALF_YEARLY: Annual Premium / 2
    YEARLY: Annual Premium
    ONE_TIME: Annual Premium √ó Term Years
}
```

### Example Calculations
- **Life Insurance**: Coverage ‚Çπ50,00,000, 20 years, Monthly
  - Annual: 50,00,000 √ó 5% = ‚Çπ2,50,000
  - Monthly: ‚Çπ2,50,000 / 12 = ‚Çπ20,833.33

- **Health Insurance**: Coverage ‚Çπ10,00,000, 5 years, Yearly
  - Annual: 10,00,000 √ó 8% = ‚Çπ80,000

- **Term Insurance**: Coverage ‚Çπ1,00,00,000, 30 years, Quarterly
  - Annual: 1,00,00,000 √ó 3% = ‚Çπ3,00,000
  - Quarterly: ‚Çπ3,00,000 / 4 = ‚Çπ75,000
